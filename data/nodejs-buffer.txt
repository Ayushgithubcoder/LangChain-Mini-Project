Buffers in Node.js

Buffers are used to handle binary data in Node.js. They represent fixed-size chunks of memory.

Creating buffers:
const buf1 = Buffer.from('Hello');
const buf2 = Buffer.alloc(10);
const buf3 = Buffer.allocUnsafe(10);

Buffer methods:
- buf.toString(): Convert to string
- buf.length: Get buffer size
- buf.copy(): Copy buffer
- Buffer.concat(): Concatenate buffers

Buffers are essential when working with file systems, network protocols, and binary data formats.
