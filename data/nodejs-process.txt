Process Object in Node.js

The process object provides information about and control over the current Node.js process.

Common properties:
- process.argv: Command line arguments
- process.env: Environment variables
- process.cwd(): Current working directory
- process.exit(): Exit the process
- process.version: Node.js version

Example:
console.log('Node version:', process.version);
console.log('Current directory:', process.cwd());

You can listen to process events like 'exit', 'uncaughtException', and 'SIGINT'.
