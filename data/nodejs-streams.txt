Streams in Node.js

Streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination continuously.

Types of streams:
- Readable: Read data (fs.createReadStream)
- Writable: Write data (fs.createWriteStream)
- Duplex: Both read and write
- Transform: Modify data as it's written and read

Example:
const fs = require('fs');
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

readStream.pipe(writeStream);

Streams are memory efficient and great for handling large files.
